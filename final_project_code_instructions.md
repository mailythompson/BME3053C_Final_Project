# Gait in Neurodegenerative Disease Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing gait dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases using the dataset from PhysioNet.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found at the following link: [Gait in Neurodegenerative Disease Database](https://www.physionet.org/content/gaitndd/1.0.0/).

The data is derived from the original publication:
Hausdorff JM, Lertratanakul A, Cudkowicz ME, Peterson AL, Kaliton D, Goldberger AL. Dynamic markers of altered gait rhythm in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. *J Applied Physiology*; 88:2045-2053, 2000.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**
   - Go to the [Gait in Neurodegenerative Disease Database](https://www.physionet.org/content/gaitndd/1.0.0/).
   - Download the ZIP file containing the dataset.
   - Extract the contents to a directory on your local machine.

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you extracted the dataset.

3. **Run the Code**
   - Ensure your Python script is in the same directory as the dataset or adjust the file paths in the code accordingly.
   - Execute the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

   Replace `your_script.py` with the name of your Python file.

4. **View Results**
   - After running the script, check the output files or visualizations generated by the code.
   - Analyze the results based on the provided dataset.

## Notes

- Make sure to review the code for any specific configurations or parameters that may need adjustment based on your analysis needs.
- For further information on the dataset and its structure, refer to the documentation provided on the PhysioNet website.
